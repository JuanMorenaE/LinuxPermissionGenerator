# Usage
In Linux, there are three main types of users in terms of permissions: 
- Owner: Is the user who owns the file or directory.
- Group: Users who belong to the group associated with the file can have certain permissions on it.
- Other: This category refers to all other users who are neither the owner nor part of the group associated with the file or directory.
  
By checking the checkboxes below each type, you can choose which type of permission you want to assign for each.

Once you finish assigning the permissions, the chmond command will be display below the table,
just copy it and paste it in your Linux Terminal, following with the file or folder you want to change.

e.g: 
```console
sudo chmond 755 myFile.txt
```
